# 🎨 Etch-a-Sketch

An interactive browser-based Etch-a-Sketch drawing app.

This project was created as part of The Odin Project to practice **DOM manipulation, dynamic layout generation, and event handling** without any frameworks.

## 🚀 Overview

This is an interactive Etch-a-Sketch drawing pad built with vanilla JavaScript.

The grid is generated dynamically using the DOM. Users can hover over squares to “draw” on the board, resize the grid, and choose any color using a color picker.

## 🛠️ Features

- Dynamic grid generation (size × size)
- Color picker for custom drawing colors
- Hover-to-draw interaction
- Grid resizes while keeping the same total board size
- Old grid clears before creating a new one
- Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## 🧠 What I Practiced

This project focuses on core frontend fundamentals:

-- DOM methods (`createElement`, `appendChild`, `querySelector`)
- Generating elements dynamically using loops
- Creating large grids efficiently
- Using Flexbox to simulate a grid layout
- Clearing and rebuilding DOM nodes
- Event listeners (`click`, `mouseover`, `input`)
- Working with form inputs (`type="color"`)
- Handling user input with prompts
- Managing state with variables (grid size, color)
- Debugging layout math (box model, borders, sizing)
- Performance considerations when generating many elements
